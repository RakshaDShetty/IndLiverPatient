## Indian Liver Patient Analysis using Machine Learning

Liver Disease is one of the most serious health issue everywhere and every individual must have a little understanding about it, symptoms, age factor and so on.
In this project I've used Machine Learning model for the analysis and prediction purpose. 

I have downloaded the dataset from the UCI ML Repository and the link is mentioned below.
